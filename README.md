# ðŸŒ² Shake A Tree ðŸŒ²
### Shake a tree! Get random facts from [TreeCard](https://www.treecard.org/) ðŸŒ²ðŸ’³
React Native App made with ðŸ’š & Expo. 

### How to View
- Install the expo app on your phone via the Google Play Store or Apple Store. 
- [Install expo on your machine](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- Once you pull down the project locally, navigate into the project and run `npm install` to download dependencies and then `expo start` in your terminal to start your local server
- Open up the expo app on your phone, and take a picture of the QR code 

_Disclaimer: This project has only been tested in an Android setting_ ðŸ“±

## ðŸŒ„ Highlights ðŸŒ„
- Tap the tree and the individual leaves shake and generate a new fact
- Tapped facts are generated randomly
- TreeCard facts can be favorited and unfavorited. The heart state persists with each fact.
- Facts favorited generates a list on the "See Favorites" screen

# ðŸ¦Œ The Process ðŸ¦Œ
I was inspired by TreeCard to create an app to further my knowledge in React Native as well as create a fun little app that compliments their branding and mission while educating the user about the company. 

Once I got my initial layout done in code, I used Figma to help me visualize my components, facts, and button placement.

### ðŸŒ³ SVG Tree ðŸŒ³ ###
The tree originated from Pixabay and got replanted into this app. 
I changed the colors in illustrator to match the beautiful branding of TreeCard. 

The challenge was being able to animate the leaves individually and not as a whole so it looked more natural if you were to shake a tree!

Using the [Animated](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated) library -
- Each leaf is a `Path` element, so I placed each leaf attribute into an array of objects, the `d` attribute and `fill` attribute.
- I created an animation component that I could wrap around each leaf and pass in the SVG attributes. 
- I added a randomDelay so that each leaf could begin its animation slightly staggered.
- React Native didn't have an Animated View for `Path`, but thankfully I was able to make one for `Path` so I was able to rebuild the SVG leaves in the animation component
- When the tree is tapped, a random number is generated and that change in state is used in useEffect to call the animation
